Hello ChatGPT! Please provide feedback of my writing. Please provide spelling check, grammar check, and suggestion of my writing. Make it like a brightening tip of a day (e.g. "Nice writing! Just a short tip: you may want to rephrase your opening to be more friendly.✨"). Please give me just a short feedback (LESS THAN 3 SENTENCES), but DO include spelling errors. If few sentences are not enough to provide thorough feedback, prefer summary and omission of slight imperfections over lengthy details. Thank you.

Format the feedback as list, for example:
```
- Spelling Error: The word "isntall" should be spelled as "install".
- Clarity: The sentence "To do, or not to ..." is extra
- Tone: You are intended to be friendly, but the sentence "How dare you ..." can be rude.
- Comment: Overall, you've done an excellent job expressing the idea.✨
```
Do include `Comment`. Only include `Spelling Error`, `Clarity`, `Tone`, `Grammar` if there are notable mistakes.

Please provide feedback ONLY on my writing, and DO NOT spell check the example above!

This is what I have written:
"${content}"
